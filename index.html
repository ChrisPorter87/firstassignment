              <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
              <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are
                searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on
                their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you
                to increase your visibility and find the right customers for
                your business.

                <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>

            
              <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative.
                Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say
                whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation
                Management gives you the control over what potential customers
                see when they search for your business.

              <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
              <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying
                habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which
                platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the
                right markets and increase your lead generation.

            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="./lead-generation.png" />
            <p>
              Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your
              business, bringing customers directly to your website.

            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
            <p>
              Users find your business through paid and organic searches,
              increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.

            <p>
              As the search ranking for your business increases, your
              advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise
              your page.
